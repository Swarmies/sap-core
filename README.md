## Workflow

Under the `install` folder you will find `macInstall.sh` or `windowInstall.bat` base on your OS you can run either or. Once you run the installers, you should have Docker and VScode installed. If you are on windows you will have `wsl2` installed on your machine.

If that went perfectly, you can run the `vsextensionInstaller.sh` on your terminal (`wsl` if you are on windows). This will install all the necessary extension for you to work with `docker` on VScode. 
If you are expreiencing 'code: command not found', Make sure you have [code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac) command installed in your path.
